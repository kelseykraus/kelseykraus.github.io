### About ##

I work at the intersection of semantics, pragmatics, and prosody, with a focus on how intonation and discourse particles shape speech acts, especially in expressions of surprise. On the computational side, I focus on human-centered, ethical, and transparent use of data in AI research. My recent work looks at how to use human feedback to improve model evaluations, with an emphasis on curating meaningful data and aligning model behavior with real-world contexts and user needs.

I'm an Assistant Professor of Computational Linguistics at San José State University. Before that, I received my PhD in Linguistics from <a href="https://linguistics.ucsc.edu" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">UC Santa Cruz</a>, and spent time in the tech industry working as a Linguist and Data Scientist for Google, Amazon, and Cisco.
